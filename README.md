# HackEPS
In this repository you can find the work done in the HackEPS 2018 at Lleida, were we won the BonÀrea challenge with a prize of 1000€.

There are two main directories, SEMIC and BonArea. Every directory was a challenge in that Hackaton, with a prize for every challenge.

SEMIC challenge was a series of small challenges, puzzles and coding.

BonÀrea challenge was a data science project, where we have to predict why some clients were stopping buying at their stores. In that challenge we used different machine learning models and we did a data analysis in R to give to the client (Bon Àrea) understanding of their own data.
